// Object Oriented Programming (OOP) - The idea / "programming philosophy" of combining types of data with methods that access or modify that data

// class - aka "type" - The "blueprints" for Objects in object oriented programming
// object - aka "instance" - One particular copy of a class, one "construction", created from the "blueprints" of the a class
// properties - The data attached to every object - essentially, factors that distinguish one "object instance" from another - e.g. "key value"
// method - A function defined in the class, and attached to the instance, that accesses or modifies data in the instance
// constructor - A special method that gets run when a object is created ("instantiated"), used to set up all of the properties

// instantiation - The process of creating a new object instance from a class


///////////// Inheritence related terms
// class inheritence - Uses the "extends" keyword to create a "subclass"
// extends - Says one class should copy everything about another class
// override - When a "subclass" (one that is doing the extending / copying) has a method with the exact same name as the base class (the one being copied), the subclass method "overrides" the base class method (WITHOUT affecting the base class)
// super - A special keyword in JavaScript that lets us access a "overridden" method even though it is overridden
